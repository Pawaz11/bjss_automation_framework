## BJSS Automation Framework

### Tests carried out:

**Test 1** Navigate to https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/
Click Challenging DOM
Confirm that the red button label changes after it's clicked

**Test 2** Navigate to https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/
Click Dynamically Loaded Page Elements and click Example 2: Element rendered after the fact
Confirm 'Hello World!' is rendered after the loading bar dissapears

**Test 3** POST to the http://dummy.restapiexample.com/ create route and verify you receive a response that indicates that a user was made.

Tests 1 and 2 are carried out using cucumber and Capybara. These tests also use the page object model for a more organised and structured file structure. A report for tests 1 and 2 is included in the reports folder in html format.

The third task is tested using Rspec. It creates a new user and checks for the 200 status code to indicate the request was successful. If you go to "http://dummy.restapiexample.com/api/v1/employee/id", replacing the *id* with the id generated by running the test, it should display the entry that was added as a result.

## How to run
To run the tests, you need to download/clone the repo and run ```bundle install``` to download all the required gems needed for the tests to run. Run the ```cucumber``` for running tests 1 and 2. To run the third test, you need to execute ```rspec spec``` command and it should run the test, posting a new entry to the api and displaying what was posted on the cli.

### Other projects
*Asos Framework* - I have created a web automation framework for the Asos website which created a few simple tests like searching for a product, adding it to the basket and checking it has been added to the basket.

*hangman* - as part of training, I created a web-based version of hangman. It uses the HTML, CSS and Javascript as core technologies. This project was created using the agile approach where I had 2 sprints split over the week.
